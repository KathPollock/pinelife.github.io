<p>As you move through the dark rooms of the house, people look away from their friends and girlfriends to see your face. 
  Yours is the face of a young woman with a lot of naked pictures of herself on her phone. Attached to your face are a head, 
  neck and fully-clothed body which is intent on two things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Being grateful for 70 hours of life not wasted watching <i>Gilmore Girls</i></li>
  <li>Looking for Chen Li</li>
</ol>
<p>The floor is carpeted with crushed off-brand Costco corn chips. Through a room full of black, grey, and navy t-shirts, you see Chen Li
  leaning over the kitchen sink to drink from the tap. The crowd seems to part. Everyone but Chen Li falls out of focus. Diegetic music and 
  background party noise fades out and you hear your own romantic soundtrack (maybe something like <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONIJXHvoynw" target="_blank">this</a>? 
  Or <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2MtEsrcTTs" target="_blank">this</a>? Anything you want - it's all up to you).
  When he rests his arm on the bench you can see a tensed muscle on the back of his arm above his elbow - you don't know what it's called 
  but it looks good. He has a half-eaten Kit Kat sticking out of his pocket. You've never spoken to him before but you're dying 
  to know what his breath smells like. 
</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Magna C** Laude: In Which You Get Brave and Make Yourself Known To Chen Li</h3>
<p>You slide along the kitchen bench until you're right beside him. You tuck your hair behind your ears - you always do this when you're nervous or turned on. 
<br/>
  <br/>
  You say: What's your take on Hemingway? I'm halfway through <i>For Whom The Bell Tolls</i> - I just wanna hear him talk about erectile dysfunction.<br/>
  <br/>
  Quoth Chen Li: The guy with the limp dick is in <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>.<br/>
  <br/>
  Oh, that makes sense. I was wondering how he was gonna weave erectile dysfunction into a story about the Spanish civil war.<br/>
  <br/>
  Yeah. I'm Clive.<br/>
  <br/>
  Oh.<br/>
  <br/>
  What?<br/>
  <br/>
  Haha nothing. I'm Allison.<br/>
  <br/>
  He shakes your hand - normally you object to being touched but his hand is warm and he's perilously cute. His teeth are whiter than his eyeballs.
  You imagine you can fill his pulse in his wrist: the same blood that has touched every part of his body.<br/>
  <br/>
  I heard your pitch about the porn thing.<br/>
  <br/>
  Oh yeah? What did you think?<br/>
  <br/>
  It sounds cool. You want a beer?<br/>
  <br/>
  Sure, thanks. Do you think I'm onto something?<br/>
  <br/>
  Uh I'm not sure. I think you're right that the porn industry or whatever is prejudiced against Asian guys and obviously it'd be good to see 
  that change but you might be overestimating how much attention guys pay to the guys in porn. <br/>
  <br/>
  You don't care what the guy looks like at all?<br/>
  <br/>
  Yeah not really. Ideally I want to see as little of the dude's face and body as possible.<br/>
  <br/>
  Right.<br/>
<br/>
  I don't wanna think about him.<br/>
  <br/>
  I should have done some market research before I started this. <br/>
  <br/>
  It doesn't mean it won't work though.<br/>
<br/>
 Haha come on, I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot.<br/>
<br/>
   No no no, just because I don't care about the guy in the porn doesn't mean that
  an Asian porn studio is doomed or anything. There are probably chicks that have an Asian fetish who would be interested - <br/>
  <br/>
  Haha yeah<br/>
  <br/>
  - so you might as well give it a go. Worst case: it's received as regular porn and fairs as well in the market
  as any other porn does. Otherwise maybe I'm way off and there's a huge segment of the population baying for Asian dick
  and you're gonna be rich.<br/>
  <br/>
  Would you be interested in getting involved?<br/>
  <br/>
  He smiles at nothing and wipes his hands on his trousers. I'm kinda busy with uni and my other extracurriculars at the moment.<br/>
  <br/>
  Okay.<br/>
  <br/>
  Yeah, sorry.<br/>
  <br/>
  What are you doing later?<br/>
  <br/>
  Haha it's already 2:30, I don't know how much later it can -<br/>
  <br/>
  Do you wanna come back to my place?<br/>
  <br/>
  Uh.<br/>
  <br/>
  It's not far.<br/>
  <br/>
  Okay.<br/>
  <br/>
</p>

Smash cut to: Chen Li spooning you in bed. He still has his jeans on but he dropped his belt, wallet, 3 lighters, half a pack of 
  Dunhill Blues and $12.30 in change on your bedroom floor. You can feel the pulse in his dick.<br/>
  <br/>
  Eventually he says: come here.<br/>
  <br/>
  You roll over so you're face to face. Now you know: his breath smells like stale beer and cigarettes. <br/>
   <br/>
   He says: you should kiss me.<br/>
  <br/>
  You want to, but you also want to act virginal so you lean back a bit and say no. <br/>
  <br/>
  Don't you like me? <br/>
  <br/>
  Haha no.<br/> 
  <br/>
  This is a lie. You've thought of nothing but him for 5 months. Now he's touched your sheets you'll never wash them again.<br/>
  <br/>
  He laughs.<br/>
  <br/>
  Of course you do eventually kiss him. And it's Heaven: romantic music swells, cute woodland animals emerge and look on adoringly, 
  angels drape garlands of flowers around the bed, and God gives you two thumbs up. The whole time you think how great it is 
  being difficult and virginal: he's dying for you to touch him and you're dying to touch him too. But you'll make both of you wait just because you can.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  He doesn't stay for breakfast in the morning but takes your phone number and kisses you goodbye at the door. The second the door closes you feel
  thoroughly alone. You stand by the door half naked, wearing only one sock. You wanted him to stay forever. 
  You feel like crying but decide not to. You are confident that he will message you but having to wait 
  days to see and touch him again hurts. At least it gives you time to plan your outfit for the next time you see him.
</p>
<p>What do you want to do today? You can devote yourself to self improvement by <a href = "Room7.html">working on FuckLyf and your new 
	porn production studio</a></p> or you can risk it all and jump to <a href ="excitingevent1.html">a contextless exciting event</a> (who knows what it'll be - 
a high impact and horrifyingly graphic sex scene complete with crude MS Paint illustrations? Suicide by Drano?).
