<p>As you move through the dark rooms of the house, people look away from their friends and girlfriends to see your face. 
  Yours is the face of a young woman with a lot of naked pictures of herself on her phone. Attached to your face are a head, 
  neck and fully-clothed body which is intent on two things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Being grateful for 70 hours of life not wasted watching <i>Gilmore Girls</i></li>
  <li>Looking for Chen Li</li>
</ol>
<p>The floor is carpeted with crushed off-brand Costco corn chips. Through a room full of black, grey, and navy t-shirts, you see Chen Li
  leaning over the kitchen sink to drink from the tap. The crowd seems to part. Everyone but Chen Li falls out of focus. Diegetic music and 
  background party noise fades out and you hear your own romantic soundtrack (maybe something like <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONIJXHvoynw" target="_blank">this</a>? 
  Or <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2MtEsrcTTs" target="_blank">this</a>? Anything you want - it's all up to you).
  When he rests his arm on the bench you can see a tensed muscle on the back of his arm above his elbow - you don't know what it's called 
  but it looks good. He has a half-eaten Kit Kat sticking out of his pocket. You've never spoken to him before but you're dying 
  to know what his breath smells like. 
</p>

<h3>Magna C** Laude: In Which You Get Brave and Make Yourself Known To Actual Human Angel Chen Li</h3>
<p>You slide along the kitchen bench until you're right beside him. You tuck your hair behind your ears - you always do this when you're nervous or turned on. 
<br/>
  <br/>
  You say: What's your take on Hemingway? I'm halfway through <i>For Whom The Bell Tolls</i> - I just wanna hear him talk about erectile dysfunction.<br/>
  <br/>
  Quoth Chen Li: The guy with the limp dick is in <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>.<br/>
  <br/>
  Oh, that makes sense. I was wondering how he was gonna weave erectile dysfunction into a story about the Spanish civil war.<br/>
  <br/>
  Yeah. I'm Clive.<br/>
  <br/>
  Oh.<br/>
  <br/>
  What?<br/>
  <br/>
  Haha nothing. I'm Allison.<br/>
  <br/>
  He shakes your hand - normally you object to being touched but his hand is warm and he's perilously cute. His teeth are whiter than his eyeballs. <br/>
  <br/>
  I heard your pitch about the porn thing.<br/>
  <br/>
  Oh yeah? What did you think?<br/>
  <br/>
  It sounds cool. You want a beer?<br/>
  <br/>
  Thanks. Do you think I'm onto something?<br/>
  <br/>
  Uh I'm not sure. I think you're right that the porn industry or whatever is prejudiced against Asian guys and obviously it'd be good to see 
  that change but you might be overestimating how much attention guys pay to the guys in porn. <br/>
  <br/>
  You don't care what the guy looks like at all?<br/>
  <br/>
  Yeah not really. Ideally I want to see as little of the dude's face and body as possible.<br/>
  <br/>
  Right.<br/>
<br/>
  I don't wanna think about him.<br/>
  <br/>
  I should have done some market research before I started this. <br/>
  <br/>
  It doesn't mean it won't work though.<br/>
<br/>
 Haha come on, I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot.
<br/>
   No no no, just because I don't care about the guy in the porn doesn't mean that
  an Asian porn studio is doomed or anything. There are probably chicks that have an Asian fetish who would be interested - <br/>
  <br/>
  Haha yeah<br/>
  <br/>
  - so you might as well give it a go. Worst case: it's received as regular porn and fairs as well in the market
  as any other porn does. Otherwise maybe I'm way off and there's a huge segment of the population baying for Asian dick
  and you're gonna be rich.<br/>
  <br/>
  Would you be interested in getting involved?<br/>
  <br/>
  He smiles at nothing and wipes his hands on his trousers. I'm kinda busy with uni and my other extracurriculars at the moment.<br/>
