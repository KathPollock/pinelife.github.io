<p>As you move through the dark rooms of the house, people look away from their friends and girlfriends to see see your face. 
  Yours is the face of a young woman with a lot of naked pictures of herself on her computer. Attached to your face are a head, 
  neck and fully-clothed body which is intent on two things:
<ol>
  <li>Being grateful for 70 hours of life not wasted watching <i>Gilmore Girls</i></li>
  <li>Looking for Chen Li</li>
</ol>
