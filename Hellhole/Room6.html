<p>As you move through the dark rooms of the house, people look away from their friends and girlfriends to see your face. 
  Yours is the face of a young woman with a lot of naked pictures of herself on her phone. Attached to your face are a head, 
  neck and fully-clothed body which is intent on two things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Being grateful for 70 hours of life not wasted watching <i>Gilmore Girls</i></li>
  <li>Looking for Chen Li</li>
</ol>
<p>The floor is carpeted with crushed off-brand Costco corn chips. Through a room full of black, grey, and navy t-shirts, you see Chen Li
  leaning over the kitchen sink to drink from the tap. The crowd seems to part. Everyone but Chen Li falls out of focus. Diegetic music and sound fades and you hear your own romantic soundtrack.
  When he rests his arm on the bench you can see a tensed muscle on the back of his arm above his elbow - you don't know what it's called 
  but it looks good. He has a half-eaten Kit Kat sticking out of his pocket.
