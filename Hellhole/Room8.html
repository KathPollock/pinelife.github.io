Turns out that lip tingling wasn't anything romantic: it was a cold sore. You've never had one before but obviously suspect Clive.
  Web MD diagnoses that the tingling foreshadows a face crater and an inexorable rash. Now you wish you'd sucked his dick to give him back his herpes where it hurts.
  The internet seems thoroughly divided over whether keeping it moist helps it heal fastest or if it's better to dry it out.
