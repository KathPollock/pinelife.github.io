    <b>The Story So Far...</b>
    <ul>
      <li>You got dolled up to go to a house party</li>
      </br>
  <li>You struck a Faustian bargain with Satan which (so far) hasn't led to any issues</i></li>
  </br>
 <li>You run a relationship advice blog called Fucklyf</i></li>
  </br>
<li>Your housemate is addicted to <i>Ice Road Truckers</i></li>
  </br>
<li>You guys don't get on because he's been trying to covertly move his girlfriend into your house</i></li>
<br/>
<li>You pitched your all-Asian porn studio at a house party</li>
  </br>
<li>You hit on Chen Li at a house party and lured him back to your lair (actually just your bedroom) where you kissed him and touched 
him in a mostly PG way</li>
  </br>
<li>Ever since then, you've felt a swooning sense of romance: tingling lips, missing a guy you hardly know, etc.</li>
   </ul>
    </p>
</div>
<p>
Fast forward three days and it turns out that lip tingling wasn't anything romantic: it was a cold sore. You've never had one before but obviously suspect Clive.
  Web MD diagnoses that the tingling presages a face crater and an inexorable rash. Now you wish you'd sucked his dick to give him back his herpes where it hurts.
  The internet seems thoroughly divided over whether keeping it moist helps it heal fastest or if it's better to dry it out.
  </p>
<p>
  You decide to go big on drying it out and spend half an hour watching anime with the hair dryer unleashing Armageddon on
  the the corner of your mouth.

<p>What do you want to do next? You can <a href = "Room9.html">explore your potential</a> or you can 
  risk it all, fling yourself through the gate to Oblivion, and enjoy <a href ="excitingevent2.html">a contextless exciting event</a>.
