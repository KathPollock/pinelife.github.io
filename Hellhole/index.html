<p>You are standing in front of a dilapidated castle: you see ivy, gargoyles, shadowy figures peering through broken windows - it's your standard hellscape. The castle is surrounded by a moat filled with <b>sharks and crocodiles</b> - they seem to be busily engaged in some kind of internecine interspecies warfare but might take a break from chomping each other to have a go at you. You can <i>enter</i> the castle or <i>pussy out</i> and plunge to probable doom in the moat.</p>
