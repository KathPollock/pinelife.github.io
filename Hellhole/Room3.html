<p>You'd better gather evidence so you're equipped for this argument. Ben has stealthily been moving his girlfriend into your share house for the past three months or so, 
  hoping you wouldn't notice. She takes up room on the sofa, consumes resources, hogs the bathroom, and once 
  excluded you from their coupley Sunday morning breakfast (blueberry pancakes). Normally you could live with 
  this, but when you stole some of the bodywash she left in the shared bathroom it gave you a  rash on your 
  left breast so you are seeking vengeance.</p>

<h3>Leatherface and Loofahs: An Investigation</h3>
<p>You head to the bathroom to collect evidence and to snoop through 
  their things: you sniff various colognes, moisurise your legs with expensive-looking face creams, read the 
  label of his girlfriend's 'intimate feminine wash' (brand "EVE"), examine a box of condoms for details on 
  size, and draw the Bat-Signal in talcum powder leftovers on the bench. All clues point to the presence of a 
  live-in girlfriend: your argument has a solid foundation.</p>
