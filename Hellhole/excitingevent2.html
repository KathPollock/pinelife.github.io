<h3>Exciting Event #2: I Wanna Be Patronised</h3>

<p>
  Standing perfectly still in a darkened hallway beside your parents' bedroom, you concentrate all your powers on listening.
  Through the door you hear your dad whisper: baby, be gentle. I've never done this before.<br/>
  <br/>
  The sound of a girl's chuckle.<br/>
  <br/>
  You imagine you can hear intense eye contact and blood moving at haste around their bodies. In the wine dark night, you 
lean your head against the plasterboard and imagine the terrible things occurring on the other side of the wall:
 wet, white, wonderful - your dream girl is defiling your dad.
 </p>

  Here's the background: as a novelty during school soccer practice a few months ago, they let you play against the girls' team. She marked you near her team's
  goal and said she was going to wear you like a glove which, at the time, you thought was insanely sexy but later learned was
  standard fare for sporting shit talk when your uncle said it to you during a game of footy over Christmas. Anyway, for most of the game 
  her forearm was pressed up against your chest and when her ponytail whipped you in the face you smelt the artificial tropical 
  paradise of her conditioner. At the end of the game she bent over to pull up her socks and looked back at you between her 
  legs - it was basically the hottest thing you'd ever seen IRL.
