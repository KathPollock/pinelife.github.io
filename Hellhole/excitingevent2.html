<h3>Exciting Event #2: I Wanna Be Patronised</h3>

<p>
  Standing perfectly still in a darkened hallway beside your parents' bedroom, you concentrate all your powers on listening.<br/>
  Through the door you hear your dad whisper: baby, be gentle. I've never done this before.<br/>
  The sound of a girl's chuckle.<br/>
  <br/>
  You imagine you can hear intense eye contact and blood moving at haste around their bodies. Is heavy petting ever audible?
  You wouldn't know.
</p>
<p>
  That's called <i>in media res</i>. Here's the background: your dad is about to bone down with a girl from school
  who you liked, kissed badly at a school dance and then accidentally dumped on her birthday.
</p>
<p>
  As a novelty during school soccer practice a few months ago, they let you play against a girls' team. She marked you near her team's
  goal and said she was going to wear you like a glove which, at the time, you thought was insanely hot but later learned was
  standard fare for sporting shit talk when your uncle said it to you during a game of footy over Christmas. Anyway, for most of the game 
  her forearm was pressed up against your chest and her ponytail would occassionally whip you in the face. When she bent over to 
  pull up her socks, she looked back at you between her legs and smiled.
