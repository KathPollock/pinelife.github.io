Before getting down to business you spend three minutes searching your desk drawers for snacks. Having found a packet of roasted 
  and salted pistachios, you chew through the nuts, spitooing the shells into the gap behind your desk as you go.

  Dear Lauria,<br/>
  <br/>
 I know how this is going to sound (totally demented) but I can't help it - I'm going insane from jealousy. My high school boyfriend was recently 
  charged in relation to a string of murders which occurred in our home town. When I say string of murders, what I mean is that he is a serially killer:
  he serially killed people. All the girls he killed were dark haired, lean little gazelles with tanned skin and side parts. The police are still pulling them out of the creeks, rivers and dams back home. 
  A hiker accidentally put his boot through one's skull the other day. They don't even know how many of them he stashed in the bush.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="indented">
So all of this is very bad and I bet you feel sorry for me because the first boy I ever loved is a necrophiliac and you're probably thinking
  how sad I must be that the guy who taught me to kiss has expended so much time and energy over the corpses of a bunch of dead girls but never
  bothered to wish me happy birthday on Facebook - which, sure, yes, that sucks. But what's really getting me is that he clearly had a 
 'type' - all of the girls he killed were tanned and dark haired. I'm pale and freckled. It's killing me knowing that I wasn't his type. He was
  He was my first love and I feel so humiliated that I wasn't desirable to him. Or that I wasn't an object of fascination for him the way he was for me.
  I know how insane this is - that I'm upset because he probably wanted to murder me. Is this just my weird way of processing shock and 
  grief or am I actually this self-absorbed and insecure?

  Hey Jealous Readhead, <br/>
   <br/>
  Yes, you are selfish. People have lost their daughters: there are girls who died horrible deaths and whose bodies may never be found.
  Your ex raped them and animals ate them and scattered their bones around the bush. Their families will never know what happened to 
  them. Their dads will never sleep well ever again. Their brothers will get bad tattoos of their faces or birth dates to honour their 
  memory. Christmas will never be the same. 
</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify" class="indented">
  But I also relate - probably lots of people reading this did. It's not that you wanted to be 
  murdered (or, if you do, that's your own business). Everyone has insecurities - this is maybe the extreme version of being a white guy 
  and finding out that your girlfriend only watches Asian porn. It would hurt: you want the people you care about to be attracted to you. 
  You want them to think about you the way you think about them. 
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="indented">
  I have one consolation: if you aren't his physical type but he still took the time to date you, there must be some pretty great things
  about you. Or maybe he was just desperate and couldn't find anyone else - what do I know?

  Have a great weekend everyone!
