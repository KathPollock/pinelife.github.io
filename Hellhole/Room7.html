Before getting down to business you spend three minutes searching your desk drawers for snacks. Having found a packet of roasted 
  and salted pistachios, you chew through the nuts, spitooing the shells into the gap behind your desk as you go.

  Dear Lauria,<br/>
  <br/>
 I know how this is going to sound (stupid - or possibly demented) but I can't help it - I'm going insane from jealousy. My high school boyfriend was recently 
  charged in relation to a string of murders which occurred in our home town. When I say string of murders, what I mean is that he is a serially killer:
  he serially killed people. All the girls he killed were dark haired, lean little gazelles with tanned skin and side parts. The police are still pulling them out of the creeks, rivers and dams back home. 
  A hiker accidentally put his boot through one's skull the other day. They don't even know how many of them he stashed in the bush.</p>
<p>
So all of this is very bad and I bet you feel sorry for me because the first boy I ever loved is a necrophiliac and you're probably thinking
  how sad I must be that the guy who taught me to kiss has expended so much time and energy over the corpses of a bunch of dead girls but never
  bothered to wish me happy birthday on Facebook - which, sure, yes, that sucks. But what's really getting me is that he clearly had a 
 'type' - all of the girls he killed were tanned and dark haired. I'm pale and freckled. It's killing me knowing that I wasn't his type. He was
  my first love and I feel so humiliated that I wasn't desirable to him. I know how insane this is - that I'm upset because he never wanted to murder me.
Is this just my weird way of processing shock and grief or am I actually this self-absorbed and insecure.
