Before getting down to business you spend three minutes searching your desk drawers for snacks. Having found a packet of roasted 
  and salted pistachios, you chew through the nuts, spitooing the shells into the gap behind your desk as you go.

  Dear Lauria,<br/>
  <br/>
 I know how this is going to sound (totally demented) but I can't help it - I'm going insane from jealousy. My high school boyfriend was recently 
  charged in relation to a string of murders which occurred in our home town. When I say string of murders, what I mean is that he is a serial killer:
  he serially killed people. All the girls he killed were dark haired, lean little gazelles with tanned skin and side parts. The police are still pulling them out of the creeks, rivers and dams back home. 
  A hiker accidentally put his boot through one's skull the other day. They don't even know how many of them he stashed in the bush.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="indented">
So all of this is very bad and I bet you feel sorry for me because the first boy I ever loved is a necrophiliac and you're probably thinking
  how sad I must be that the guy who taught me to kiss has expended so much time and energy over the corpses of a bunch of dead girls but never
  bothered to wish me happy birthday on Facebook - which, sure, yes, that sucks. But what's really getting me is that he clearly had a 
 'type' - all of the girls he killed were tanned and dark haired. I'm pale and freckled. It's killing me knowing that I wasn't his type. 
  He was my first love and I feel so humiliated that I wasn't an object of fascination for him the way he was for me.
  I know how insane this is - that I'm upset because he probably didn't want to murder me. Is this just my weird way of processing shock and 
  grief or am I actually this self-absorbed and insecure?

  Hey Jealous Readhead, <br/>
   <br/>
  Yes, you are selfish. People have lost their daughters: there are girls who died horrible deaths and whose bodies may never be found.
  Your ex raped them and animals ate them and scattered their bones around the bush. Their families will never know what happened to 
  them. Their dads will never sleep well ever again. Their brothers will get bad tattoos of their faces or birth dates to honour their 
  memory. Christmas will never be the same. 
</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify" class="indented">
  But I also relate - probably lots of people reading this did. It's not that you wanted to be 
  murdered (or, if you do, that's your own business). Everyone has insecurities - this is maybe the extreme version of being a white guy 
  and finding out that your girlfriend only watches Asian porn. It would hurt: you want the people you care about to be attracted to you. 
  You want them to think about you the way you think about them. 
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="indented">
  I have one consolation: if you aren't his physical type but he still took the time to date you, there must be some pretty great things
  about you. Or maybe he was just desperate and couldn't find anyone else - what do I know?

  Have a great weekend everyone!
</p>
<p>Out the corner of your eye you see Ben's girlfriend Francesca trying to creep down the hallway past your room she's carrying
  her shoes in her hands and has her bag tucked under her arm. She stares determinedly at the carpet.
Ben has probably told her about the argument you had over her douche wash. You should say something.
</p>
<p>
  Hey Franky - did you get up to much last night<br/>
  <br/>
  She is instantly suspicious. Why?<br/>
  <br/>
  No reason. I got back pretty late and Ben was still up.<br/>
  <br/>
  So?<br/>
  <br/>
  I thought you guys might have been having an <i>IRT</i> marathon or something.<br/>
  <br/>
  What's <i>IRT</i>?<br/>
  <br/>
  <i>Ice Road Truckers</i>, you know, that show about the guys who drive over frozen lakes in Canada.<br/>
  <br/>
  Why would we watch that?<br/>
  <br/>
  Ben never told you? He's a hardcore fan. He's travelled to the US for the last 5 years to go to <i>IRT</i> Con. He's got 
  every season on Blu-ray and DVD. We don't even own a Blu-ray player. He's a complete devotee. Did you never wonder why he always 
  wears trucker hats?<br/>
   <br/>
  She doesn't say anything.<br/>
   <br/>
  You guys have been dating for - what - like 6 months now? I wonder why he never...<br/>
  <br/>
  He's never said anything about trucks. He told me he didn't even like TV.<br/>
  <br/>
  Aren't you guys planning a trip to Canada together? Do you think - I mean, is it possible...<br/>
  <br/>
  He said we would go skiing.<br/>
  <br/>
Franky, Ben's never skied in his life.<br/>
  <br/>
  Oh god.<br/>
  <br/>
  I'm not one to give relationship advice but, you know, this seems like a pretty huge betrayal. To keep such a huge part of 
  his life from you, for basically no reason. Really makes you wonder what else he might have kept from you.<br/>
  <br/>
  She sniffles.<br/>
  <br/>
  Do you think he ever really meant to take you skiing? Or did he just want to drive on those ice roads?<br/>
  <br/>
  Oh god.<br/>
  <br/>
  What are you going to do?<br/>
  <br/>
  I don't know - do you think I should talk to him?<br/>
  <br/>
 Are you kidding? He lied to you - do you really want to be with someone who would treat you this way, some one who would take
  you to Canada under the pretence of a ski trip but actually just taking you driving on ice roads? Franky, do you really think he 
  deserves a second chance?<br/>
  <br/>
  I don't know. What do I do?<br/>
  <br/>
  The biggest show of strength would be to be gone when he comes home. Make him stew and reflect on his failings. He
  can work for it if he wants your forgiveness.<br/>
  <br/>
  She's still sniffling but she nods.<br/>
  <br/>
  </p>
<p>And so another happy relationship is ruined by <i>Ice Road Truckers</i>.</p>
