<h3>Exciting Event #3: Honeypottin' Hitler</h3>

<p>
On a particularly wintery evening in Krakow, two figures stumble down a cobblestoned street. 
  They are completely loaded: the condensation in their exhaled breath is 99% wine, when they kiss 
  their wives good morning in a few hours they will still taste of wine. Possibly the wine taste will never go
  away. It's 1941: oral hygiene is not a priority right now.

 I know I called them figures earlier but that's just because I wanted you to imagine misty shapes in long coats
  emerging out of the darkness: these are men, not just figures. One of the men has his coat tied around his neck like a cape and is
  prancing around while his buddy uses a wine bottle to blow out a poor approximation of a folk jig.
