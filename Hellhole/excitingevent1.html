<h3>Contextless Exciting Event #1: I Wanna Be Patronised</h3>
<p>
  Friday night in your zone of the planet. The girl who lives next door, scarcely sixteen, in nothing but a bath towel, is hauling in 
  her rubbish bins and waving at your stupid husband. Difficult to say which of them you hate more.
</p>
<p>
  In a final desperate attempt to save your marriage you have been contemplating having a threesome to reignite your husband's interest. 
  The problem is that you don't have any female friends, you hate every woman you meet and you're fiercly jealous of your stupid husband's attention and affection.
  What to do? Get a sex clone, obviously.
</p>
<p>
Don't question the clone thing too much. Let's just say it's 2023, an alien spaceship crashed near Adelaide four years ago and was full of cloning
  technology (as well as alien corpses and this ominous machine which started slowly counting down from 666,666 on Christmas day 2022 when a drunk scientist accidentally spilled gravy on it). 
  So cloning technology quickly made its way into the mainstream consumer market: people clone themselves for back up organs, people clone 
  themselves so between their original selves and their clone self they can work 24 hours a day, people clone back up kids and pets, people clone themselves so they
never have to break up with thier boyfriend. For a while people were cloning themselves so the clone could commit crimes on the original's behalf but lawmakers quickly fixed that loophole. The original is responsible for the actions of the clone.
  Only trick which remains: it's not against the law to kill yourself so clone murder, while frowned upon, is legal.
