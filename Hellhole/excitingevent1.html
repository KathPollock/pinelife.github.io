<h3>Contextless Exciting Event #1: I Wanna Be Patronised</h3>
<p>
  Friday night in your zone of the planet. The girl who lives next door, scarcely sixteen, in nothing but a bath towel, is hauling in 
  her rubbish bins and waving at your stupid husband. Difficult to say which of them you hate more.
</p>
<p>
  In a final desperate attempt to save your marriage you have been contemplating having a threesome to reignite your husband's interest. 
  The problem is that you don't have any female friends, you hate every woman you meet and you're fiercly jealous of your husband's attention and affection.
  What to do? Get a sex clone, obviously.
</p>
<p>
Don't question the clone thing too much. Let's just say it's 2023, an alien spaceship crashed near Adelaide four years ago and it was full of cloning
  technology (as well as alien corpses and this ominous machine which started slowly counting down from 666,666 on Christmas day 2022 when a drunk scientist accidentally spilled gravy on it). 
  So cloning technology quickly made its way into the mainstream consumer market: people clone themselves for back up organs, people clone 
  themselves so between their original selves and their clone self they can work 24 hours a day, people clone back up kids and pets, 
  people clone themselves so they can avoid breaking up with thier partner. It got really out of hand: people were cloning themselves just 
  to see what their hair looked like from the back. Initially, people were also cloning themselves so the clone could commit crimes on the 
  original's behalf but lawmakers quickly fixed that loophole: the original is responsible for the actions of the clone.
  Only trick which remains: it's not against the law to kill yourself so murdering your own clone, while frowned upon, is legal. 
</p>
<p>
  You can see where this is going. 
</p>
<p>
  You wait until your husband is knee-deep in his Friday night routine (beer and sports) before you sneak out to the nearest 7/11. 
  Even though you live in the seething depths of suburbia, you can see five 7/11s from your drive way. Ominously, the night sky is filled with bats who crowd around the 
  convenience stores, attracted by the swarms of bugs who are in turn attracted by the eternal flame of the fluorescent lights. What wonders has the future wrought. 
 </p>
<p>
  The clone machine (7/11's own brand is the Echo Chamber) sits next to the Slurpee machine - the floor is sticky from amniotic fluid and high-calorie cola flavoured slush. 
  You place your finger in the DNA Extraction Slot (someone has used permnanent marker to helpfully label it as The Glory Hole) and when you remove it, the machine has extracted 
  1ml of blood and bandaged your finger. You scan your universal currency card on the reader to confirm the transaction and the Echo Machine deducts 5,560 units. A super sized 
  Slurpee costs 5,999 units. The machine will take ~5 minutes to do its thing. You are completely alone in this 7/11. You stand around 
  sucking on your Slurpee and trying to look unobtrusive. You think about how people used to joking call themselves corporate drones for 
  working as mindless robots in retail jobs and now machines have replaced them. You wonder if drone in this sense referred to a worker 
  bee, a drone for the colony, or maybe to the low, monotonous sound of a machine at work. Both seem to fit. This convenience store is 
  really just a bank of vending machines grouped together under the glowing 7/11 sign and the whirling bats. 
</p>
<p>
  Eventually, the door to the Echo Chamber opens like a fridge and there's your clone. No liquid nitrogen or scifi music. She has the same 
  hair as you - how do they do that? That's the creepiest part of this whole thing - how do they perfectly recreate your hair? She even has the same
  razor burn and wrinkles and pimples and scars as you. She looks around stupidly. Her paper dress rustles in the air conditioning. 
</p>
<p>
  You stash your clone in the garden shed for the night with a 2L bottle of pre-mixed sangria, a bag of potato chips and an iPad so she can watch Netflix and porn - you
  want her to be a convincing simulation of an adult woman by tomorrow and a sleepless night spent watching <i>Friends</i> and masturbating is the quickest way to get her there.
