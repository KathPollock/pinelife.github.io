<h3>Contextless Exciting Event #1: I Wanna Be Patronised</h3>
<p>
  Friday night in your zone of the planet. The girl who lives next door, scarcely sixteen, in nothing but a bath towel, is hauling in 
  her rubbish bins and waving at your stupid husband. Difficult to say which of them you hate more.
</p>
<p>
  In a final desperate attempt to save your marriage you have been contemplating having a threesome to reignite your husband's interest. 
  The problem is that you don't have any female friends, you hate every woman you meet and you're fiercly jealous of your stupid husband's attention.
