<h3>Satanic Herpes</h3>
<p>
To summon Satan, you need to activate your tattoo - if tattoo activation reminds readers of the bad guys from a famous children's story,
let that tell them something about how that author achieved her success. The bargain JK Rowling struck was that she would be famous and 
successful beyond her wildest dreams, but that she would desecrate her legacy by being an idiot on Twitter. Satan made his offer in 1996,
long before Twitter even existed, so it sounded reasonable to Ms. Rowling at the time. When Twitter launched a decade later, she felt 
herself inexorably drawn to the platform: after all, she was an internationally beloved author, year after year she outsold the Bible,
world leaders read her books to their children every night - surely people would want to know what she thought about US politics and
the latest scandal surrounding YouTube personalities.
</p>
<p>
To begin the process of summoning Satan, you pull off the pyjama shirt you've been wearing all day to reveal the tattoo beneath
your right breast. You lick your thumb and run it along the words: Daddy's Angel. Behind your window blinds, Satan appears - 
you see his elbow sticking out the side. He deliberately clears his throat. You pull your
 shirt on, dim the lights and turn on the smoke machine.

<p>
The fake smoke swirls excitedly as Satan emerges from behind the blinds, Hawaiian shirt unbuttoned to his navel, smiling goofily: 
stupidly handsome, beatific, blonde, chiseled, he's standing on two dainty cloven hooves - really more deerlike than caprine. 
</p>
<p>Satan runs a hand through his hair self-consciously. <span class="Satan">What's good?</span></p>
<p class="lauria">
Just chillin.
</p>
<p>
	He gives you a sly look.
</p>
<p class="lauria">
	Haha what? I <i>am</i> just chilling.
</p>
<p class = "Satan">
	It's Saturday night - shouldn't you be three knuckles deep in some club skank?
</p>
<p class="lauria">
	Couldn't be bothered.
</p>
<p class = "Satan">
	What? Putting underwear on?
</p>
<p>
	You open your mouth to say something but he steals your joke.
</p>
<p class = "Satan">
	That never stopped you going out before.
</p>
<p class="lauria">
	Jeez, I wouldn't've invited you over if I knew you were gonna be such a wang.
</p>
<p> Satan is unlike God in many respects (the Hawaiian shirts, the chiseled jaw, his prefernce for chaos over order, etc.) but the
difference which is pertinent to this situation: he can give but he cannot take away. It's worth noting, that
although it is usually not a very esteemed power, Satan can also mitigate.
</p>
<p class="Satan">
That's the thing, honestly: it's not that I <i>want</i> to screw people over, it's just because of the nature of my powers, 
I can't get things perfect for people. It really makes no sense, from a business perspective, for me to screw people over: I want
their repeat business.
</p>
<p class="lauria">
I know, I believe you.
</p>
<p>
	Satan stares at his hands.

Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head, and he fell to the ground and worshiped. He said, "Naked I came from my
 mother's womb, And naked I shall return there. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away. Blessed be the name of the LORD." 
	Through all this Job did not sin nor did he blame God.â€¦</p>
