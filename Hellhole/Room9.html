<h3>Satanic Herpes</h3>
<p>
To summon Satan, you need to activate your tattoo - if tattoo activation reminds readers of the bad guys from a famous children's story,
let that tell them something about how that author achieved her success. The bargain JK Rowling struck was that she would be famous and 
successful beyond her wildest dreams, but that she would desecrate her legacy by being an idiot on Twitter. Satan made his offer in 1996,
long before Twitter even existed, so it sounded reasonable to Ms. Rowling at the time. When Twitter launched a decade later, she felt 
herself inexorably drawn to the platform: after all, she was an internationally beloved author, year after year she outsold the Bible,
world leaders read her books to their children every night - surely people would want to know what she thought about US politics and
the latest scandal surrounding YouTube personalities.

You pull off the stinky pyjama shirt you've been wearing all day to reveal the tattoo beneath your right breast.
You lick your thumb and run it along the two words: Daddy's Angel. Behind your window blinds, Satan's feet appear.
He deliberately clears his throat. You pull your shirt on, dim the lights and turn on the smoke machine.
</p>
<p> Satan is unlike God in many respects, pertinent to this situation: he can give but he cannot take away. It's worth noting, that
although it is usually not a very esteemed power, Satan can also mitigate.

<p class="Satan">
That's the thing, honestly: it's not that I <i>want</i> to screw people over, it's just because of the nature of my powers, 
I can't get things perfect for people. It really makes no sense, from a business perspective, for me to screw people over: I want
their repeat business.
</p>
<p class="lauria">
I know, I believe you.
</p>
<p class="Satan">
It actually really fucking hurts my feelings that people would think I'd do this shit on purpose.
</p>
<p class="lauria">
It's honestly not a big deal - I know you didn't mean to do it.
</p>
<p>Satan starts to cry.<span class"Satan">
I try so fucking hard and I still screw everything up.
</span></p>
<p class="lauria">
Please don't be upset - I love you, I trust you, I believe you. Please don't get upset.
</p>
Satan smiles through his tears. You're both quiet for a minute while he gets himself together.
<p class"Satan">
I never told anyone that before.	
</p>
<p class="lauria">
I won't tell anyone. You can trust me.
</p>
<p class="Satan">
Did you mean what you said?
</p>
<p class="lauria">
Which bit?
</p>
<p class="Satan">
About loving me?
</p>
<p class="lauria">
Sure -
</p>
<p>
Satan smiles.
</p>
<p class="lauria">
- as a friend.
</p>
<p>
His face falls. <span class="Satan"> Right, yeah, of course - you love me as a friend.</span>
</p>
<p class="lauria">
We'll always be friends, you know that, right?
</p>

Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head, and he fell to the ground and worshiped. He said, "Naked I came from my
 mother's womb, And naked I shall return there. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away. Blessed be the name of the LORD." 
	Through all this Job did not sin nor did he blame God.â€¦</p>
