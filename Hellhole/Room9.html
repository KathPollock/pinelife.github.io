<p>Strap yourselves in because this is an intercoursingly good story: it’s about the difference between what you tell people you 
  think is right and what you actually do. You want to try something genuinely heroic and a fire seems like a good first mission. You soak your 
  woollen clothes in water, you create a bot which notifies you whenever a Melbourne news Twitter 
  account tweets anything from the following list:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fire</li>
    <li>Inferno</li>
    <li>Vesuvius 2.0</li>
    <li>... in scenes reminiscent of the underrated 1991 movie <i>Backdraft</i>...</li>
    <li>Conflagration</li>
    <li>... more firery and dramatic than when the Globe Theatre burnt down in 1613...</li>
    <li>Hair dryer explosion</li> 
    <li>... burning senasation that could only be caused by skin literally being on fire...</li>
</ul>
<p>So you know about every house fire worth knowing about in Melbourne: now it's just a matter of biding your time, waiting for the perfect one to drop in on.
With modern heat and smoke detectors, sprinklers and the recent trend away from cremation, people are getting better at leaving their homes
  before fire can kill or seriously harm them. These are not easy times to be a hero. Few people require saving.

  When you do finally make your move, your car won't start so you have to take the bus to the apartment fire. To preserve your anonymity, 
  you're wearing an eye mask you crafted by cutting eye holes in an old soccer sock. You're also wearing a costume of soaking wet merino
  wool thermals because you think you read one time about how wool doesn't burn. Every step you take squelches as your wet  
  clothes relieve themselves of water. You ruin the bus seat with your sodden thermals plus you had to fare evade since your costume has 
  no pocket for your Myki. When you get off the bus you set off at a steady trot in the direction of the towering inferno in the 
  distance. It's a gate to Oblivion: the night sky is cracked with red, smoke curls around the stars, birds flee in terror. It's a gate to
  Fallujah: children gawp, women weep and wail, men in uniforms perspire and move around in groups. No one pays attention to the girl 
  lumbering past them in wet thermals.

  You can feel the heat on your face from a block away. This is no joke. Firemen stand about looking figuratively and literally hot. 
  Outside the building's glowing radius, reporters crowd in the shadows. None of them wear ties or long sleeved shirts. 
  Make up women rumple their hair and smudge ash on their cheeks so when they shed a single sorrowful tear it'll look spectacular on camera.
  A woman is using bed sheets and a bucket to lower her cat to safety. You confidently dip under the safety tape. A fireman tries to 
  stop you but you remind him of every human's fundamental right to do suicidally stupid things whenever they want and he backs off. 
  Your thermals are steaming before you even get through the front door. Like an idiot, you call the elevator. When the doors half 
  crack open, smoke gasps out and you hear the ominous groaning of metal. Better take the stairs.

The building - it’s burning, but don’t worry: everything’s gonna be alright. Listen, self: you’re okay, everything will be alright. Nothing good gets 
  away. It will be okay. Don’t worry if it’s burning: you’re okay. It’s only a fire, it’s just a baby, there are lots like it. Like I 
  said just before, nothing good gets away. Nothing good gets away. Read this again. You’re trying, that counts for something, Allison. 
  Allison, please don’t be sad if the baby is burnt by the time you get there. Everything’s gonna be alright. Nothing good gets away.</p>
<p>
 Sorry: your skin will heal in time — just minor burns. Curious that your skin responded to the flames at all. Um. Even with the stunning quantity 
  of water your eyebrows can hold after a shower, it was not enough to keep you safe in that apartment. And now, your whole body has become a cherry kitty 
  litter scab: there is thick scentless oil buried in you.
