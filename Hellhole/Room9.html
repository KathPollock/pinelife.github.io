<h3>Attempt at a Rushdie pun: Satanic Herpes</h3>
<p> Satan is unlike God in many respects, but, pertinent to this situation, he can give but he cannot take away. Also, and this 
	is not usually a very esteemed power, but Satan can mitigate.

Oh, please, you've had it easy.

Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head, and he fell to the ground and worshiped. He said, "Naked I came from my
 mother's womb, And naked I shall return there. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away. Blessed be the name of the LORD." 
	Through all this Job did not sin nor did he blame God.â€¦</p>
