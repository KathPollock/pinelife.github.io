<p>Strap yourselves in because, really, this is an intercoursingly good story: it’s about the difference between what I’ll tell people I 
  think is right and what I actually do. I want to try something genuinely heroic.
</p>
<p>
A fire seems like a good place to start. You create a bot which notifies you when a Melbourne news Twitter account tweets something including
  one or more of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fire</li>
    <li>Inferno</li>
    <li>Vesuvius 2.0</li>
    <li>Hair dryer explosion</li>
    <li>... in scenes reminiscent of the underrated 1991 movie <i>Backdraft</i>...</li>
    <li>... more firery and dramatic than when the Globe Theatre burnt down in 1613...</li>
    <li>... burning senasation that could only be caused by skin literally being on fire...</li>
</ul>
<p>So you know about every house fire worth knowing about in Melbourne: now it's just a matter of biding your time, waiting for the perfect one to drop in on.
With modern heat and smoke detectors, sprinklers and the recent trend away from cremation, people are getting better at leaving their homes
  before fire can kill or seriously harm them. These are not easy times to be a hero. Few people require saving.
</p>
<p>
  Nevertheless, you 
  I’ll just soak my woollen clothes in water, and start being a hero. The building - it’s burning, 
  but don’t worry: everything’s gonna be alright. Listen, self: you’re okay, everything will be alright. Nothing good gets 
  away. It will be okay. Don’t worry if it’s burning: you’re okay. It’s only a fire, it’s just a baby, there are lots like it. Like I 
  said just before, nothing good gets away. Nothing good gets away. Read this again. You’re trying, that counts for something, Allison. 
  Allison, please don’t be sad if the baby is burnt by the time you get there. Everything’s gonna be alright. Nothing good gets away.</p>
<p>
 Sorry: your skin will heal in time — just minor burns. Curious that your skin responded to the flames at all. Um. Even with the stunning quantity 
  of water your eyebrows can hold after a shower, it was not enough to keep you safe in that apartment. And now, your whole body has become a cherry kitty 
  litter scab: there is thick scentless oil buried in you.
