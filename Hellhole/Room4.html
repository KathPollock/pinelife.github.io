<p>The party you're heading to is being held by a university's Asian Students Society - you're not Asian and you're not a uni student, 
  but you've got a crazy business idea and you need attractive Asian guys to get it off the ground. Plus, Chen Li, a 20-something computer 
  science student who teaches the Instagram for the Geriatric class at the local community centre might be there.</p>
