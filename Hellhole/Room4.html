<p>The party is being held by a university's Asian Students Society - you're not Asian and you're not a uni student, 
  but you've got a crazy business idea and you need attractive Asian guys to get it off the ground. Plus, Chen Li, a 20-something computer 
  science student who teaches the Instagram for the Geriatric class at the local community centre might be there.</p>
<p>
As per your bargain with Satan, you don't cross the threshold of the party until 11:01pm. The lights are dim, the punch is too watery, 
  the music is bad, and it's impossible to tell if it's a costume party or if people are just dressed like idiots for fashion reasons. Great party.

<p>
You spend the first hour pounding drinks in the backyard with the smokers, trying to psych yourself up for your big pitch: 
  the paperwork is in your bag. The smokers inhale and ash and gesture with their hands a lot and don't seem particularly interested in you
  until, c. 12:13am, you decide to dial up the charm: you take off your bulky coat to reveal your binding clothes, push out your breasts,
  and start to talk to the guys about porn.
</p>
<p>
You deliver a stirring speech, something like: wouldn't jerking off be inifintely more pleasurable if you could jack it to Western-made porn where straight Asian
  dudes were 1) acknowledged as existing and 2) depicted as desirable and competent lovers? Porn has developed niches to 
  appreciate (or fetishise, if you wanna be like that) women of all races. And most races of men. But not Asian guys. The under 
  representation of Asian men in the porn industry is a travesty which has been allowed to continue for too long. There are more
  than 4 billion people living in Asia but no decent porn starring men of that heritage has ever been produced. Asian male sexuality
  has become an object of ridicule (thanks a lot, tentacle porn) so the small amount of porn produced showing Asian males 
  is blurred (and typically very weird). Not any more. Just as God made us in his image, so shall we make porn in our image.

 Of course, this line of argument is nothing new, but hearing it from a pretty girl makes it seem insightful. You pull out a wad of position descriptions: you are assembling a porn production studio and will need
  performers, a camera crew, producers, editors, script writers, etc. Applicants can apply via email at careers@fucklyf.com. The production studio will be
  called FuckLyf Presents... New Cum Den (FNCD) and will follow the Brazzers approach: short clips available on porn tube sites with premium content behind a paywall.
  All male performers will be of Asian heritage. FNCD will initially target Asian guys (especially in China and India) with a view 
  to expanding to the broader porn market in the longer term. The aim will be to keep production costs very low initially - you are ponying up $10k of your own cash to make the first two films.
