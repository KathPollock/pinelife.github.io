<p>Just kidding. Can you imagine if the story started so sloppily? What kind of moat could possibly accomodate sharks <i>and</i> crocodiles? (Unless of course we're dealing with somekind of world-first estuarine moat which keeps the water temperate and salty enough to please both saltwater crocodiles and bull sharks - two species which famously fair well in both salt and fresh water.)

Anyway, just to give you an idea of what you're getting into: this is an ultraviolent rom com. You play a young woman who writes a relationship advice blog. What the one problem she can't solve? Finding a man (and also disposing of a body).

It's Friday night: you and your house mates are heading to a house party. You've shaved your entire body (except your head), you're wearing your most binding clothes and are finishing your makeup in your room while drinking a cocktail of your own invention: a Moscow Goatfuck.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Moscow Goatfuck Recipe</h3
<li>
  <ul>Lime wedge</ul>
  <ul>1 cup vodka</ul>
  <ul>Tablespoon fresh lime juice</ul>
  <ul>1/2 cup ginger beer</ul>
</li>
<p>(Pro tip: it's just a regular Moscow Mule but with four times the vodka.)</p>

(Author's note: first decision point coming tomorrow. Gotta figure out what to do next...)
