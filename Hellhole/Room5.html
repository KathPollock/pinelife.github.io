<p>When you get home, Ben is lying on the couch watching late-night informercials. He pretends not to see you. You head for the kitchen to grab a snack - you turn all the lights on, slam cupboards, and leave the fridge door open a jar so it beeps. Ben pretends not to hear anything. You retreat to your room with a huge sack of potato chips.</p>
<p>
You leave the blinds open as you wriggle out of your clothes. The skirt was so binding that it has cut pink marks into your waist. 
  You get into bed naked with your bag of chips. Your laptop has been running ceaselessly since Tuesday morning and has left a warm spot in 
  your bed where a boyfriend is supposed to go. You fire up a Ken Burns documentary. The sound of chip mastication inside your own head is 
  so loud that you can't hear anything of the show. 
</p>
<p>
When you wake up, the credits for the final episode in the documentary series are rolling up the screen. Your bed is filled with 
  crushed chips.
</p>

<p>Seeing the wreckage from last night's binge you swear to yourself that you will only eat shredded lettuce for the next three days. You shut the lid of your laptop and try to go back to sleep. After about an hour, you give up on sleep and feel around in the blankets and shards of potato chips for your phone.</p>

<p>For the fifth time this week you snoop through Chen Li's Instagram. He created the account three years ago, posted five pictues
  and then obviously got sick of it and never posted again. The photos have cancer filters and are shockingly dull: his attempt at
  cooking bolognese, a super close-up of his dog's face, a sunrise (or possibly a sunset), a vaguely amusing numberplate, and a
  picture of him looking appreciatively at a huge rack of ribs. The photos are bad and boring but you like them because they're his.
  Next you check his Facebook. It's all set to private but you visit it every so often just to see if he's updated his profile 
  picture. He's had the same picture for the last four months: a selfie in his bathroom mirror. Bathroom bench in disarray. Toilet 
  seat up. It's a stupid photo but you like it because it's his.</p>

<p>
	You first encountered Chen Li six months ago at the local community centre - you were there to take a pottery class when you saw
  him in the linoleum-lined corridor: that whole crowd parting, everyone else falling out of focus, swelling of romantic music thing
  happened so you knew he was something special. The only class he teaches is Facebook for the Geriatric which there is no plausible
  reason for you to attend so now you have to admire him from afar via the internet.
