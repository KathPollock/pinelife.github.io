<p>When you get home, Ben is lying on the couch watching late-night informercials. He pretends not to see you. You head for the kitchen to grab a snack - you turn all the lights on, slam cupboards, and leave the fridge door open a jar so it beeps. Ben pretends not to hear anything. You retreat to your room with a huge sack of potato chips.</p>
<p>
You leave the blinds open as you wriggle out of your clothes. The skirt was so binding that it has cut pink marks into your waist. 
  You get into bed naked with your bag of chips. Your laptop has been running ceaselessly since Tuesday morning and has left a warm spot in 
  your bed where a boyfriend is supposed to go. You fire up a Ken Burns documentary. The sound of chip mastication inside your own head is 
  so loud that you can't hear anything of the show. 
</p>
<p>
When you wake up, the credits for the final episode in the documentary series are rolling up the screen. Your bed is filled with crushed chips.
