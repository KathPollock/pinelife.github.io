Already feeling pretty stupid for undertaking this - it's bigger than I expected and is probably already spiraling a bit. I know it's obvious
  but every fork creates different story outcomes/activities and it's just gonna spread out of control. I was talking to Meowgre about it and she 
  suggested that I try to merge the story back together but I want the choices the player makes to feel meaningful.

  I've decided on the key fork for now anyway. The person who dies depends on whether the player spoke to Chen Li or that party or not. In 
  one scenario, you dispose of your housemate's body with Chen Li. In the other you accidentally kill Chen Li with your horrible cooking and end up 
  having to dispose of his body yourself because you know you will not play well in the court of law or public opinion (mostly because 
  you gave so much horrible advice online and <i>The Herald Sun</i> will eat you alive.
