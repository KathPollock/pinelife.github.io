<p>You write under the name of Lauria Moria. Your website FuckLyf typically attracts ~100,000 unique visitors per month which is enough to earn you around $100/month in ad revenue. This isn't even enough to cover a week's worth of beer and fried chicken costs so in conjuntion with your relationship advice posts, you offer a highly sought after service: nudes assessments. For $10 per image or $15 per video, users can submit nudes to you and receive honest and constructive feedback on which parts of their bodies to highlight/Photoshop, tips for lighting and suggested angles. Naturally this has degenerated into men sending you photos of their dicks and you copy/pasting an email full of compliments.</p>

<p>You also run a scam using Amazon. On your website you advertise your Amazon wishlist - people can browse the list and buy things for you as gifts. When you first started doing this, your wishlist included normal things like books, muesli bars, and toilet paper. But you found that no one was interested in buying these things for you. Now you have overhauled your wishlist so it includes 10L vats of personal lubricant, handcuffs, uncomfortable underwear, leather harnesses, Lolita outfits, etc. People love buying these things for you. When you receive these items in the mail, you return them to Amazon to receive credit on your account which you then use to buy household essentials like dish soap, tinned soup, and socks.</p>

<p>You are a very attractive young woman. You look like someone out of an ad for expensive coffee: black hair, dark eyes, puffy lips, warm skin, fully functional organs, etc. This is why men want to buy you vats of lubricant.</p>

<p>So your website is a wretched hive of scum and villainy, but you are serious about giving people genuine advice on how to have happy, healthy relationships. As a 24 year old who has never been in a serious relationship, you aren't exactly qualified to give this advice, but people seem to listen anyway.</p>
